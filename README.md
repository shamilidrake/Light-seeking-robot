# Light-seeking-robot
The 4x4 Light-Seeking Robot, equipped with four strategically placed light sensors, autonomously navigates diverse terrains. Ideal for education and research, its modular design and advanced algorithms provide a hands-on experience for experimenting with autonomous navigation in dynamic environments.
We use some guidance from youtube about the coding. Here we are credit to Hash Robotics youtube channel. ( https://youtu.be/WyqIdIPh0Js?si=q1G6__mbJ_iFaZ-x ) 
We also modified the code since we add another 2 sensor at the rear of the 4x4 robot.
